/*Package configmeta provides a configutil metadata type to provide a canonical location to hold common config variables.

It provides a couple common variables to set with ldflags on build, namely `configmeta.Version` and `configmeta.GitRef`.

These can be set at build time with `go install -ldflags="-X github.com/zpkg/blend-go-sdk/configmeta.Version=$(cat ${REPO_ROOT}/VERSION)" project/myapp` as an example.

The typical usage for the configmeta.Meta type is to embed in a config type and resolve it in your resolver.

Config Example:

    type Config struct {
		configmeta.Meta `yaml:",inline"`
	}

	// Resolve resolves the config.
	func (c *Config) Resolve(ctx context.Context) error {
		return configutil.Resolve(ctx,
			(&c.Meta).Resolve,
		)
	}

This will pull `SERVICE_NAME` and `SERVICE_ENV` into relevant fields, as well as `configmeta.Version` into the Version field.

This type is used in a number of other packages for common fields like service name and service environment.
