Package consistenthash contains helpers for mapping items to buckets using consistent hashing.

Methods (AddBucket, Assignment etc.) typically run in `log2(N*M)` time where N is the number
of buckets and M is the number of virtual replicas in use (which defaults to 16).
This is strictly worse than a typical map, but avoids space issues with tracking item
assignments individually.

The default hash function is `crc64.ChecksumIEEE` but that can be customized. The default hash
function is seeded with a constant polynomial so that assignments are stable between process starts.

A `*consistenthash.ConsistentHash` reference (the result of `New(...)`) is safe to use
from multiple goroutines and will use a read/write mutex to synchronize changes to internal state.

Example usage:

    ch := consistenthash.New(
		consistenthash.OptBuckets("worker-0", "worker-1", "worker-2"),
	)
	// figure out which bucket an item maps to
	worker := ch.Assignment("item-0") // will yield `worker-0` or `worker-1` etc.

You can tune the number of virtual replicas to reduce the constant time hit of most operations
at the expense of bucket to item mapping uniformity.

Example setting the replicas:

    ch := consistenthash.New(
		consistenthash.OptBuckets("worker-0", "worker-1", "worker-2"),
		consistenthash.OptReplicas(5),
	)
	// figure out which bucket an item maps to
	worker := ch.Assignment("item-0") // will yield `worker-0` or `worker-1` etc.
